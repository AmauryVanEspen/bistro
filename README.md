This is an online application where you are able to make a request for good to be delivered to you.

The app is able to pick up the address that you write in the address dialog box and show it on a map just like uber does.

Future improvements will be the ability to pick up the location via gps or IP address.

The user functionality is there and though at the moment a user can see what another user has ordered. One can not edit anoter person's request.
